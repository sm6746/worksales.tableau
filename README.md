Tableau Project
Description
This project utilizes Tableau, a powerful data visualization tool, to create insightful and interactive visualizations from various datasets. Tableau enables users to explore data, discover trends, and communicate findings effectively through intuitive dashboards and interactive charts.

Features
Interactive Dashboards: Create interactive dashboards that allow users to explore data dynamically and gain insights through filtering, highlighting, and drill-down capabilities.
Wide Range of Visualizations: Tableau offers a diverse set of visualization options including bar charts, line graphs, scatter plots, maps, heatmaps, treemaps, and more, catering to different data types and analytical needs.
Data Connection: Connect Tableau to various data sources such as databases, Excel files, CSV files, cloud storage, and web data connectors, enabling seamless integration of data for analysis.
Advanced Analytics: Utilize Tableau's built-in analytical functions and calculations to perform complex data analysis, predictive modeling, and statistical operations directly within the tool.
Sharing and Collaboration: Share interactive dashboards and visualizations securely with stakeholders or collaborate with team members by publishing to Tableau Server, Tableau Online, or embedding in web pages.
Customization and Branding: Customize the appearance and branding of dashboards to align with organizational standards, including colors, fonts, logos, and layout.
